Celulitt README

Celulitt is Norwegian election results calculation for the rest of us. That is:
those of us who won't pay for NSD's "Celius". Or those of us who enjoy
controlling the media's use of Celius.

The data/ directory contains example data, namely the results of the 2009
election. The file is in YAML format. This makes it easy to load, modify
programatically and save data, for instance to simulate changes in the vote
or the district structure. YAML is also easy to modify directly as text files.

Celulitt is licensed according to the GPL version 3.0. See LICENSE for details.

Celulitt is written by Sigve Indregard <sigve.indregard@gmail.com>.
